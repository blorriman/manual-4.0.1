# How Meetings Work

## Asyncronhous Meetings

> _"Information can be exchanged independent of time. It doesn’t require the recipient’s immediate attention, allowing them to respond to the message at their convenience."_

:::success Info
This is the key foundation of **LORROS** - the ability to conduct a Meeting independent of time.
:::

Meetings can be scheduled to cover multiple days allowing Members to participate in discussions _(and vote on Motions)_ at their convenience.

**LORROS** Meetings are similar to a blog where Members Comment _(and Reply)_ on Agenda Items. When the Meeting is over, the Minutes are immediately available online. The Minutes and full transcript _(which includes all the Comments and Replies)_ can also be printed.

Meetings are automatically Archived when they are over and available at anytime from the [Group Home page](../../started/groupHome#archives).

:::success Info
**Notices** - You will recieve an email from **LORROS** when an **Discussion** starts, the day before it ends and when it is completed _(you cannot mute Notices)_.

**Messages** - You will recieve an email from **LORROS** everytime a Member makes a Comment or Reply _(you can [mute Messages](../during/comments#mute-emails))_
