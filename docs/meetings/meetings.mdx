# Why Use LORROS Meetings

| Problem         | Realtime                                                | LORROS                                                                         |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Time            | All participants must be available at the same time.    | Participants can fit their participation to their schedule.                    |
| Agenda Schedule | Some topics may get hurried or deferred.                | All topics can easily be fully covered.                                        |
| Agenda Sequence | Hard to go back or bring an item forward.               | Participants may comment or vote on any agenda item at any time.               |
| Time Efficiency | Participants must sit through discussion of all topics. | Participants can concentrate on topics relevant to and/or of interest to them. |

**LORROS** is a powerful meeting tool that can be used for many types of meetings. Although there may be circumstances where other meeting formats may be desired, even then, LORROS can help in making those meetings more productive by allowing them to be focussed on the more important matters.

The functionality of **LORROS Meetings** is based, as much as possible, on **Robert’s Rules**. However, there are certain aspects of LORROS Meetings that are not considered in Robert’s Rules such as the ability to comment on any Agenda Topic at any time and the ability to change your votes.

Most formal decisions should be structured and documented. The best way of doing this is through a Meeting. LORROS Meetings make it easy for groups to meet asynchronously and/or traditionally. Scheduling is not a problem since LORROS Meetings can extend multiple days making it easy to have Meetings whenever a decision needs approval.

## How It Works

:::success Info
LORROS Meetings can only be started by members with **Admin** access.
:::

> 1. An **Admin Member** creates an agenda for a meeting _(meeting can either start immediately, or any date in the future)_.
> 1. The **Notice** of the meeting is sent to all Group members with a link to the Meeting.
> 1. If the Meeting is scheduled to start in the future you can:
>    - [add additional Agenda items](./before/#adding-to-the-agenda) before the Meeting starts.
> 1. When the Meeting starts, you can:
>    - [Make Comments](./during/#comments).
>    - [Reply to Comments](./during/#replies).
>    - [Vote](./during/voting) on Motions.
> 1. When the [Meeting is over](./after), you can:
>    - Print the Minutes and/or full Transcript.
>    - Access the Meeting from the [Archives](/docs/started/groupHome#archives).
