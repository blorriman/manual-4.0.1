# Notifications

:::note Notice
**LORROS** uses email to send **Notifications**
:::

## Meeting Notifications

**LORROS** sends out a number of administrative Notices during a Meeting. These are sent to all Group members even if they have [opted out of receiving Messages](../meetings/during/comments#mute-emails).

**24 hours before a meeting starts** - this serves as a reminder which is especially helpful if the Meeting was scheduled a number of days or weeks earlier. It also alerts Members that this is the last opportunity to add Topics to the agenda.

**24 hours before a Meeting ends** - gives Notice to all members of the last chance to participate.
Since **LORROS** requires a quorum of Members to vote on a motion, it is important that enough Members participate.

**When the Meeting ends** - this Notice informs all Members that the Meeting is over and that the minutes are available. A link to the minutes is included in the email.

## Discussion Notifications

**24 hours before a Discussion ends** - gives Notice to all members of the last chance to participate in the Discussion.

**When the Discussion ends** - this Notice informs all Members that the Discussion is over.

## Polls

**Unanswered Polls** - this Notice is sent out to all Members who have **NOT** responded to a Poll 24 hours after the Poll was created.
