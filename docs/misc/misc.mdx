# Tips

We've tried to make **LORROS** as flexible and robust as possible. Different Groups will find their own **Best Practices** and we share some of these great ideas to help you get the most out of **LORROS** - [click here](../../blog)

## Clean Inbox

There is nothing worse than a bulging email inbox. With **LORROS** you will get all the email notifications _(or not if you [mute them](#mute-emails))_, but you don't need to save them. Raed them to find out what's going on and then **delete** them - you can go to **LORROS** anytime and don't need the emails to fill up your inbox.

### Mute emails

<OptinOut />

## Save Paper

Saving **paper** is good for the **environment**, so don't bother to print - everything created on **LORROS** is always available online.
