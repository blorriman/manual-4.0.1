# Discussions vs Group Emails

Let's face it ... **everyone hates Group Emails** ... but, they play an essential role in sharing Group information. **LORROS Discussions** minimize a lot of the frustrations and problems associated with Group Emails.

Below are just a few of the reasons you should use Discussions instead of Emails:

| Problem                | Emails                                                                                                                                                        | Discussions                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Starting a new subject | You must either have everyone’s email set up as a group, or enter them in manually to start a new thread, often people are mistakenly left out of the thread. | Easily start a new **Discussion**, the first email goes to everyone in the group to insure they are aware a Discussion has started.                                                                                     |
| Keeping in the loop    | If someone doesn’t use _”reply all”_, the thread gets broken.                                                                                                 | The Discussion is conducted through **LORROS** and automatically includes everyone.                                                                                                                                     |
| Out of sequence        | The thread can get confusing and hard to follow.                                                                                                              | Replies are grouped with each comment for easy reading.                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Opt in / opt out       | Some email clients like Gmail allow you to mute a discussion, but the others in the thread don’t know you’re not getting the emails.                          | Easily opt in and out of **LORROS Discussions** - everyone in the group can see who has opted out. On the last day of the Discussion, everyone _(including those opted out)_ are notified that the Discussion is ending |
