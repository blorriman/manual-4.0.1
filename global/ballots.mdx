### Blind

**Blind** voting is the default for **LORROS**. As per Robert's Rules of Order, a vote can be changed prior to the results announced. Since **LORROS** Meetings are asynchronous, a Member may vote on a motion, then want to change there vote after reading coments from other Members. The results of the vote are not available _(announced)_ until the Meeting is over.

### Visible

**Visible** voting is what usually happens in a meetings when those present raise their hands and the reult of the vote is known immediately.

### Secret

**Secret** voting is available for both Blind and Visible voting and hides how indiviual Members voted - only the results of the vote are available. If it's a Blind/Secret ballot, the Member can still change their vote.
