For a **Vote** on a Motion to be considered, a [**Quorum**](#quorum) of Members must have participated.

:::warning **IMPORTANT**
Participation includes Members who **Abstain**. By not selecting the Abstain option, you will **NOT** be included in the **Quorum** and the Motion may not reach Quorum and might not be considered.

An **Abstain** vote is **NOT** counted as a vote cast and therefore not included in the vote total.
:::

- **Passed** when **In Favour** votes are greater than 50% of the total votes.

- **Failed** when **Opposed** votes are equal to, or greater than 50% of the total votes. A tie vote **Fails** _(as per Robert's Rules of Order)_.

- **Not Considered** when a motion does not reach Quorum _(as described above)_.

A Member who chooses to abstain is considered to have participated in the vote. If there are not enough Members participating _(to reach Quorum)_ the Motion is not considered.

An example of all of this: a Group has 9 voting Members, the **Quorum** is 5
