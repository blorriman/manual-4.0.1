**Polls** are a great way to facilitate a Group towards consensus.

When phrasing a **Question** for a Poll, keep it relivent to the dialogue and as concise as possible.

:::success Info
All **Polls** must have at least 2 Answers.
:::

The **Answers** should also be concise, since only one Answer is allowed; however, you can add as many answers as you need - \_**BUT**, Polls are to help your Group reach **Consensus**, so it's best to only include Answers that will show what direction the Group is favouring.

:::success Info
**_"None of the above"_** is automatically added as a final Answer.
