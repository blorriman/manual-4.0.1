Once a Motion has been Moved and Seconded, any voting Member can **Amend the Motion**

:::success Info
**Amendments** must be _germane_ to the Motion and **NOT** a new Motion.

The Member amending the Motion is the Mover and a Seconder is required before anyone can vote on the Amenendment.

## Amendment Priority Table

**Amendments** work in reverse order - meaning, if the **2nd Amendment** passes - it is the recorded vote regardless if the **Motion** and the **1st Amendment** also pass ... and so is true for the **1st Amendment** - if it passes _(and the **2nd Amendment** fails, or is not present)_ it is the recorded vote regardless if the **Motion** also passes.

| Motion                             | 1st Amendment                      | 2nd Amendment                      | Recorded Vote                  |
