**Motions** are an important part of many Meetings. Any voting Member of the Group can add a Motion either in the Draft Agenda, or when the Meeting is in progress.

There are some _predefined Motions_ you can select from, or create a Motion from scratch.

:::success Info
Once the Meeting is in progress, two additional _predefined Motions_ are available: **Referral** and **Deferral**
