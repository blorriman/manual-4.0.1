# Getting Started

# <center>**LORROS** is for **Groups!**</center>

You need to belong to a Group to do anything in **LORROS**, you may be [invited](../../docs/started/#invitation-to-lorros) to join a Group, or you may start your own Group.

## Start a Group

Start a new **Group** directly from your Home Page.

> 1. Click the Members tab at the top of your Group Page.
> 1. In the **Add Members** box, enter the email address followed by a tab of comma.
>    1. _You can also paste a list of email addresses seperated by a comma from a csv file._
>    1. _You can remove email addresses by clicking the X prior to submitting_

The Members you have added will receive an [email](../../docs/started/#invitation-to-lorros) with the option to accept or decline the invitation to join your Group.

If the Member is NOT registered with **LORROS**, their information card will be grey indicating that they are not registered yet.

:::success Info
You can resend or cancel the invitation if they are not registered yet.
