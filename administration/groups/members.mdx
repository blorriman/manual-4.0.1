## Admin

It is possible to share the **Admin** duties with other Members of the Group. Simply turn on the Admin Switch. If you have switched the Admin on for another Member of the Group, you can switch your Admin switch off _(you will immediately loss Admin access)_.

:::caution Caution
Each Group must have at least one **Admin**, so if you are the only Admin of the Group, you cannot turn off your Admin switch.
