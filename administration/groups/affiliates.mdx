# Affiliate Groups

**Affiliate Groups** are connected as **Parent Group** and **Child Groups** _(Sub Committees)_. A Parent Group can have as many Sub Committees as needed, and Sub Committees are connected to each other as **Siblings**.

</center>

The advantages of **Affiliate Groups** are that the **Admin** of each Group can email members of any Affliate Group, as well as **Refer** [Discussions](../discussions/extend#refer-a-discussion) and [Motions](../meetings/motions#referral-motion) to Affiliate Groups.

:::caution Caution
If a Child Group _(Sub Committee)_ creates Sub Committees _(ie: grandchildren)_, these Sub Committees are **NOT** included in the original **Affilate Group**, but rather form their own _(second tier)_ Affilate Group.
:::

## Sub Committees

Any Group Admin can create as many **Sub Committees** as required. Examples of Sub Committees would be **Financial Committee**, **Governance Committee**, etc.

:::warning Attention
When naming Sub Committees be sure to choose a name easily identifed as belonging to the parent Group. For instance, if you belong to multiple Groups, "Membership Committee" could belong to any of your parent Groups. Consider prefixing it with a reference to the parent Group _(ie: using the intials of the parent Group)_.
:::

To create a Sub Committee:

> 1. Open the **Admin** tab.
> 1. Open **Add Group Committees**.
> 1. Enter the **Name** of the new Group.

## General Membership Group

**General Membership Groups** are usually larger than boards or committees. The main difference is that only Members with Admin access can start Discussions, Meetings, etc.

:::warning Warning
**LORROS** is designed for **Boards** and **Committees** and works best with smaller Groups.
If you add a large **General Membership Committee** you may experience some sluggish performance across all AffilateGroups.
