# Affiliate Groups

**Affiliate Groups** are connected as **Parent Group** and **Child Groups** _(Sub Committees)_. A Parent Group can have as many Sub Committees as needed, and Sub Committees are connected to each other as **Siblings**.

The advantages of **Affiliate Groups** are that the **Admin** of each Group can email members of any Affliate Group, as well as **Refer** [Discussions](../discussions/extend#refer-a-discussion) and [Motions](../meetings/motions#referral-motion) to Affiliate Groups.

:::caution Caution
If a Child Group _(Sub Committee)_ creates Sub Committees _(ie: grandchildren)_, these Sub Committees are **NOT** included in the original **Affilate Group**, but rather form their own _(second tier)_ Affilate Group.
:::

## Sub Committees

Any Group Admin can create as many **Sub Committees** as required. Examples of Sub Committees would be **Financial Committee**, **Governance Committee**, etc.

To create a Sub Committee:

> 1. Open the **Admin** tab.
> 1. Open **Add Group Committees**.
> 1. Enter the **Name** of the new Group.

## General Membership Group

**General Membership Groups** are usually larger than boards or committees. The main difference is that only Members with Admin access can start Discussions, Meetings, etc.

:::warning Warning
**LORROS** is designed for **Boards** and **Committees** and works best with smaller Groups.
If you add a large **General Membership Committee** you may experience some sluggish performance across all AffilateGroups.
