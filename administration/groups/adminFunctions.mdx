# Admin Functions

As the **Admin** of the Group, there are a number of functions to help with organizing and maintaing your group.

### Rename Groups

Renaming a Group can be done at any time.

### Add Resources

**Group Resources** are files that are specific to the Group _(rather than an Activity)_ such as Bylaws, Rules & Regulations, etc.

Uploading files is the same as [Adding Files to Submissions](../../docs/started/generalUsage#add-files-to-submissions)

</center>

:::note Note
They are archived separately.

### Add Committees

**Committees** are sub-groups _(children)_ of the parent Group and are automatically [**affiliated**](../groups/affiliates) so that each _(affiliated)_ Group can email and refer [Discussions](../discussions/extend#refer-a-discussion) and [Meetings](../meetings/motions#referral-motion).

When you create a **Committee**, you are automatically the Admin of the Group. Once you invite new Members, you can assign some one else as Admin and remove yourself from the Group _(if required)_.

:::note Note
Creating a Committee is the same procedure as [starting a Group](../groups/groups#start-a-group).

### Set Quorum

**Quorums** are important for validating the results of [**Motions**](../meetings/motions). **LORROS** automatically sets the Quorum at 51% of the voting Members; however, the Admin can overide the default and set the Quorum either as a percentage of the voting members or a fixed number of voting Members.

:::warning Attention
Since the fixed Quorum can never be less than the number of voting Members, **LORROS** will automatically adjust the Quorum to the lower of the fixed Quorum or the number of voting Members in the event that Members resign _(or are [removed](../groups/members#remove-member))_.

:::note Note
You can always revert back to the default _(51%)_ at any time by using the switch.
