# Admin Tabs

:::note Note
There are a number of **Tabs** that will appear at the top of the **Group** home page that are only available to the **Admin** Members.

These tabs are only visible if they are required. For instance, if there are No Referred activities ... the Referred tab will NOT be visible.
:::

## Referred

**Discussions** and **Agenda** items can be referred to other **Affiliated** Groups. This allows Groups to **Refer** an item to another Group to get their perspective.

Click the **Referred** tab to see what has been Referred to your Group. As the Admin, you can select to create a **Discussion** or a **Meeting**.

:::caution Caution
An item that is **Referred** to another Group, is **NOT** linked it becomes its own activity.

## Deferrals

It's common for **Agenda Items** to be **Deferred** to a future meeting ([**Deferral Motion**](../meetings/motions#deferral-motion)). If the **Motion** passes, the **Deferrals** tab will be visible.

Click the tab to see the Deferrals, you can start a Meeting from here. You will need to add the title of the Meeting, but the Deferred Agenda Item will be automatically entered as the first Agenda Item.
