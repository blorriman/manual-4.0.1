To **refer** a Discussion:

> 1. Click the **Refer** tab at the top.
> 1. Select the **Group** or Groups that you want to refer it to.
> 1. It's good practice to add a note about why the Discussion is being referred.
> 1. Click Submit.
>    1. _The referred Discussion will appear on the Home Page of the other Groups._
