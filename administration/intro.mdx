Each **Group** must have at least one **Administrator** _(**Admin**)_; however, there can be multiple Administrators in each Group.

:::success Info
When you create a Group you are the Admin by default, but you can add members and transfer the Admin role to any of the other Members.
:::

The main functions of the **Admin** are:

> - General management of the [**Group**](./groups/groups)
> - Adding, editing and removing [**Members**](./groups/members)
> - Starting [**Meetings**](./meetings/meetings)
> - Inviting Guests to [**Discussions**](./discussions/extend#add-guests) and [**Meetings**](./meetings/admin#invite-guests)
