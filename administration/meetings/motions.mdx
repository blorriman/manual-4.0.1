# Motions

A Motion is a proposal that the entire Group take action or stand on an issue. A Motion should express a decision in precise terms that, if approved, will be self-explanatory.

## Predefined Motions

**LORROS** includes a couple of **Motions** that are regularly used in Meetings. They are available from a dropdown when adding a Motion. These predefined Motions can be edited once they are selected.

:::note Note
**Referral** and **Deferral** Motions are only avilable once the Meetings has started.

## Deferral Motion

A Motion to **Defer** _(if passed)_ will save the Agenda Item and can be added at a future Meeting [see here](./meetings#referrals-and-deferred-items).

:::note Note
A **Deferred** Agenda Item will always be present when creating a Meeting or in the Draft Agenda until it is dealt with.

## Referral Motion

If you want to add a Motion to **Refer** an issue to an [**Affiliate Group**](../groups/affiliates), use the referral Motion from the dropdown _(it will display a list of all Affiliate Groups)_.

If the Motion passes, the Referred Agenda Item will be available to the Admin of the Group(s).
