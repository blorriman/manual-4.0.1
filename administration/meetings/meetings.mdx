# Create a Meeting

**LORROS** has made it easy to start a Meeting.

1. The default way of **Starting a Meeting** is from the **Group Home Page**.

<center>

</center>

2. If your Group has been [**Referred**](../../groups/tabs#referred-meetings) a topic from another Group.
3. If your Group has [**Deferred**](../../groups/tabs#deferrals) an Agenda Item from a previous Meeting.

:::warning Attention
You can **Abort** this process at any time by clicking the **Delete Meeting** button.

## Title of the Meeting

The **Title** of the Meeting can be used to set the **purpose of the Meeting**. Try to be as specific as possible so that it will make sense to the Members of the Group and it will be easy to find in the [**Archives**](../../../docs/started/groupHome#archives).

:::success Tip
Instead of "**Monthly Board Meeting**", use "**December 2021 Board Meeting**".

## Meeting Dates

:::note Note
Since **LORROS** Meetings are **asynchronous**, they can be scheduled to last over several days _(or jus a couple of hours)_.
:::

If is usually best practice to set the **Start Date** a few days in the future to allow Group Members to review and add **Agenda Items** before the meeting starts. The **End Date** can be anytime after the Start Date ... a couple of hours ... or a couple of days.

## Using a Template

If you saved a [**Template**](#save-as-template) you can use it to create your Agenda. Saved Templates will appear in a dropdown.

:::success Info
When youu save a **Template**; the **Motions** and **Polls** are saved, but not the **Files**.
_You will be able to edit the Agenda Items, Motions and Polls before you send out the [**Meeting Notice**](#notice-of-meeting)_.

## Add Agenda Items

Add **Agenda Items** as required. Don't worry about what order they are in, or if they are complete. You can always [**Edit**](#edit-agenda-items) them and [**Reorder**](#reorder-agenda-items) them before you send out the [**Meeting Notice**](#notice-of-meeting).
