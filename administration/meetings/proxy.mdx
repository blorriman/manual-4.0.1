**Proxy Votes** are available to the Group **Admin**. The Group Admin can Move, Second and Vote on any Motion as a Proxy from another Voting Member. Proxy Votes are marked with an asterisks '**\***' and on hover will display who Voted the Proxy Vote.

## Not Present

The Admin can also mark a Member as **Not Present**; however, if a Member has Moved or Seconded _(even if by Proxy)_ they cannot be marked as Not Present.

:::warning Attention
A Member marked as Not Present may affect the ability of the Motion to reach Quorum and therefore should be considered carefully by the Admin.

<!--
A Member marked as Not Present is treated the same as **Abstained**. Not Present Member is NOT counted as a vote cast and therefore not included in the vote total and therefore should be considered carefully by the Admin. -->
