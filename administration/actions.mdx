# Actions

In many circumstances, a Motion may require an [**Action**](../../docs/actions). **LORROS** makes it easy for an Admin to assign an Action right from a passed Motion.

:::success Info
Starting an **Action** is the same as for Members [click here](../../docs/actions#starting-an-action)
:::

## Assiging the Action

If a **Motion** is passed, the Admin will see an **ASSIGN AN ACTION** button. The button is visible during a Meeting if the Ballot Type is Visible and every Member has voted, otherwise the ASSIGN AN ACTION button will be visible in the **Minutes** when the Meeting is over.
