When you receive the information package for an upcoming meeting, you will likely have a good idea on how you will vote on any motions. But what happens when the meeting starts and someone else’s perspective causes you to question your initial opinion?

<!--truncate-->

> 1. In a [previous Article](https://mdxjs.com), we talked about how meetings would be shorter if we had a chance to share our ideas before getting together for the meeting. This also has the benefit of getting everyone’s ideas _‘on the table’_ to help you weigh your decision.
> 1. **LORROS** Meetings don’t need to end when the _‘live meeting’_ is over. Keeping a **LORROS Meeting** open for _(say 24 more hours)_ allows everyone to _‘sleep on’_ their decision if they need to. You may not need the extra time, but if others do – it will lead to better decisions and a more effective board.
